# MIT - Introduction to Deep Learning

## Context
I decided to follow this MOOC because it provides both foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms through 10 video lessons, but also practical experience in building neural networks - with applications to computer vision, natural language processing, and more - through 3 very interesting labs, using the TensorFlow library.

<br/>

## Labs description :

#### 1. Intro to TensorFlow and Music Generation with RNNs
##### Part 1 - Intro to TensorFlow
Learn the basics of computations in TensorFlow, the Keras API and how to define simple neural networks.
##### Part 2 - Music Generation with RNNs
Build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate a brand new music file that has never been heard before. We used a "character RNN" to predict the next character of a sheet music in ABC notation.
<br/>

#### 2. Computer Vision
##### Part 1 - MNIST Digit Classification
Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits from the famous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.
##### Part 2 - Debiasing Facial Detection Systems
Explore two prominent aspects of applied deep learning: facial detection and algorithmic bias.
We build a facial detection model that learns the _latent variables_ underlying face image datasets and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present in order to train a _debiased_ model.

<br/>

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Build a reinforcement learning algorithm to master two different environments with varying complexity.
To model these environment we used a toolkit developed by OpenAI called [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).
##### Part 1 - Cartpole
1st environment: balance a pole, protruding from a cart, in an upright position by only moving the base left or right.
##### Part 2 - Pong
2nd environment: the game of Pong.
